## Clarification:
---
Supervised learning is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that classify data or predict's outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.

### Pros:
- Can be very helpful in classification problems 
- Supervised Learning is a simple process to understand unlike Unsupervised learning since we dont actually know what the computer is doing.
- You can find out exactly how many classes there are before applying the data for training.
- Supervised Learning is good at predicting numerical target values from given data and labels.

### Cons:
- Since Supervised Learning is limited in tasks that it can perform, it can't handle some of the complex tasks in machine learning.
- Supervised Learning cannot give you unknown information from the training data.
- It cannot cluster or classify data by discovering its features on its own.
- Training needs a lot of computational time already especually if our data set is very large, This will test our machine's efficiency, as well as our patience as well.
