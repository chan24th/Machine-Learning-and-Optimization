## Clarification:
---
Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users does not need to observe and direct the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. Unsupervised Learning mainly deals with the unlabelled data unlike its counter part, Supervised Learning. 

Unsupervised Learning allow users to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. Although, this can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks, etc.

### Pros:
- finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
- helps find features which can be useful for categorization.
- It is easier to obtain unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data
- Since it is taking place in real time, all of our input data is analized and labeled by us.

### Cons:
- You cannot get precise information regarding data sorting, and the output as data used in unsupervised learning is labeled and not known.
- Our results will be less accurate because our input data is not known and not labeled by people in advance. This means that our machine has to do all of this itself.
- The user needs to spend time interpreting and label the classes which follow that classification.
- Spectral properties of classes can also change over time so you canâ€™t have the same class information while moving from one image to another.

If you are still a little shaky on the topic at hand, I encourage you to watch this video which brakes down Supervised Learning as simple as possible!
