## Introduction:

This Github Repository has everything that Ive been learning about in my Data Science 4 class "Machine Learning and Optimization", explained in my own way. This course covers a vast amount of topics that would be used in a work setting but because of time we may not be able to cover every topic for machine learning, Just the basics.

## Machine Learning Content
There are three main learning types in machine learning, we have Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. With this being said we are going to be focusing mainly on Supervised Learning as well as Unsupervised learning and its contents. If time permits us we might touch up on some Reinforcement Learning as well.

Supervised Learning 
- Linear Regression
- Single Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Decent
- K - Nearest Neighbors
- Multi Layer Perceptron
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Ensemble Learning

Unsupervised Learning
- K - Means Clustering
